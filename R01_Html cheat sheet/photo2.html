      <figcaption>The summer of 2019 was when I first got Discord. I've never had a reason to get onto discord until that summer. I started watching a youtuber named Sacred. I was able to join his discord and meet many awesome and hilarious people in there. It really felt like a community in there and I've enjoyed being in that discord ever since. Then I started joining other youtubers discords, like Tectone and BlastphamousHD, and my friends from home made a discord so that we can keep in touch easier when we were in college.  </figcaption>
