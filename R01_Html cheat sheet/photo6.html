      <figcaption>One of my favourite rappers and singers ive listened to is Juice World. Even though he died before Covid, It still doesnt change how much i listened to his music. when rappers die, they dont really die because a lot of times they are either A. Put into other creators Rap songs, or B. They have a lot of unreleased songs and then the producers start releasing them as some form of "Post-Death Appreciation".  </figcaption>
