      <h1>A little bit about me.</h1>
      <p>[Hi. My name is Mark Mereday Jr and I am a Gigantic nerd. Ive been a nerd for as long as i can remember.Anime, Video games and Drawing have Intensely impacted my life in more ways than one. Quarentine did not really affect me whatsoever bc a lot of my hobbies didnt involve me being outside and my schedules were not ruined bc i dont need to be outside to complete my assignments and have fun. With being isolated, These 12 objects/outlets have helped my mental state stay stable during covid, social distancing and being isolated from the real world]</p>
