      <figcaption>This is my favourite battle royale fps game of all time right now. I was never really a fan of the new COD games and cod got boring to me bc im a big fan of fantasy, magical abilities and magic. This game has cool character design, amazing lore tied with one of my favorite games, Titanfall. It is genuinly fun to play and ive been obsessed with it ever since it came out the summer of 2019. Bloodhound is my Favorite character design and lore wise. they are so cool and their past is very mysterious and also interesting at the same time.
